# Face-Recognition
# This project is build using python and OpenCV for computer vision .

#To run this first make sure that your IDE or Virtual Environment has Open CV and Computer Vision installed along with numpy and other libraries.

#After Installation of Open CV and libraries copy paste this code and make sure there is no error and run it.

#In case you are using external webcam than Under VideoCapture(0) make changes and write VideoCapture(1) to run it.

# Happiness detector is also a part of Face recognition but likewise if you are using external webam than make changes in VideoCapture .

#In happiness detector make sure your face is close to the camera and smile a little to see the rectangle box turn green on the screen.

#The recognition in both is done using fron face not side face so angles will be detcted only for the front face not side face.
